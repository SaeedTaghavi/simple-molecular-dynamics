# simple-molecular-dynamics
Some C++ code for basic (non-quantum) molecular dynamics simulations based on the Velocity Verlet algortihm.

Include `MDSim.h` to start. Define a potential as a function of a vector, define a simulation box and starting condition, configure a Thermostat if needed. Check out `example.cpp` to see how it works (requires GLUT for visuals).

Proper API description will follow in the future.
